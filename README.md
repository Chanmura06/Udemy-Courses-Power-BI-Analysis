## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project explores and analyses a dataset of Udemy courses using **Power BI**. The goal is to uncover insights into the range of courses offered, pricing trends, course ratings, and subscriber patterns.  

This end-to-end project demonstrates my ability to clean, transform, and visualise real-world data, and to communicate findings through clear, interactive reports.
